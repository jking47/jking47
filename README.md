ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Jake, I am currently learning Python and dev work in general.
I am a game designer, currently using Godot Engine, and trying to get the programming skills to build my own fully featured games.
I always prefer open source tech, and would like to start contributing once I learn enough.

Have a nice day!
